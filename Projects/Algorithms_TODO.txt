Algorithms TO DO

M1
-supervised learning? (don't have a training set, also if you can do UL, can do SL)
-unsupervised learning - expectation maximization (Baum-Welch)

M2
-L8: Burrows Wheeler transform
-L11: PCA and Sparce PCA

BONUS:
-L8: Multivariate HMMs
-L8: Hidden chromatin states
-L11: Markov clustering
-L11: Spectral analysis

Other cool algorithms discussed, don't have to do:

-L7: RNA reconstruction by mapping to genome
	-Bowtie (align spliced RNA to genome; cannot align large gaps between spliced RNAs)
	-Tophat (align spliced RNAs using splice sites after genome mapping; can link large gaps like introns)
	-Cufflinks (link splced RNAs to transcript alignments)
-L7: RNA reconstruction by aligning de novo (trinity algorithm)
-L7: Cuffdiff (probabilistic assignment of readcounts to transcripts)
[-L7: Cummerbund (applications for biological questions - not covered)]
-L13: GATK HaplotypeCaller
-L13: atlas2
