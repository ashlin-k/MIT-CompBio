Algorithms TO DO

M1
-supervised learning? (don't have a training set, also if you can do UL, can do SL)
-unsupervised learning

M2
-L6: K means clustering (UL)
-L6: Hierarchical clustering (UL)
-L6/7: Naive's Bayes classification (SL)
-L7: support vector machines (SVMs, SL)
-L7: RNA reconstruction by mapping to genome
	-Bowtie (align spliced RNA to genome; cannot align large gaps between spliced RNAs)
	-Tophat (align spliced RNAs using splice sites after genome mapping; can link large gaps like introns)
	-Cufflinks (link splced RNAs to transcript alignments)
-L7: RNA reconstruction by aligning de novo (trinity algorithm)
-L7: Cuffdiff (probabilistic assignment of readcounts to transcripts)
[-L7: Cummerbund (applications for biological questions - not covered)]
-L7: Nussinov algorithm (RNA folding)
-L7: Stochastic context free grammars ?
-L8:
